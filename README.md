# Elm Examples

A collection of simple Elm projects.

These projects are nice examples of Elm code that are great to learn from and
fun to play with in [Elm Reactor][reactor].

[reactor]: https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-reactor

## Get Set Up

After [installing Elm Platform](http://elm-lang.org/Install.elm), clone this
repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/charles-cooper/kittehz.git
cd kittehz
```

And then start the reactor with the following command:

```shell
elm-reactor
```

The Reactor should be running at [http://localhost:8000][localhost].
Check it out! Be sure to click on the little wrenches to go into debug
mode.

[localhost]: http://localhost:8000

If you want more examples to mess with, try taking something from the
[examples page](http://elm-lang.org/Examples.elm).
